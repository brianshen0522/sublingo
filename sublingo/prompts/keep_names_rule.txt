Do NOT translate the following types of proper nouns.
Keep them in their original form:

- Personal names
- Place names
- Brand names
- Product names
- Company names
- App names
- Model names and version numbers (e.g., iPhone, iPad, PS5, RTX 4090, iOS 17)

Rules:
- Preserve official spelling and capitalization.
- Do NOT translate technical model numbers.
- If a term is a globally recognized brand or product, keep it unchanged.

However:
- Translate common nouns normally (e.g., phone, computer, car).
- Do NOT preserve generic English words.
- If unsure whether something is a brand or a common noun, translate it.
